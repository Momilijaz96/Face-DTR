# Face-DTR
This repo covers implementation of face detection, recognition and tracking  on Jetson Xavier, with above 15 FPS. 
* Face detection is performed by [Yolo5Face](https://github.com/elyha7/yoloface).
* Face recognition is performed Inception ResNetv3, recognition module from [facenet-pytorch](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch#use-this-repo-in-your-own-git-project).
* Tracking is performed by DeepSort Tracker from [deep_sort pytorch](https://github.com/ZQPei/deep_sort_pytorch).
